1) Given an array, print the Next Greater Element (NGE) for every element. The Next greater Element for an element x is the first greater element on the right side of x in array. Elements for which no greater element exist, consider next greater element as ­1. Examples:
  a) For any array, rightmost element always has next greater element as ­1.
  b) For an array which is sorted in decreasing order, all elements have next greater element as ­1. c) For the input array [4, 5, 2, 25}, the next greater elements for each element are as follows. Element NGE
  4 --> 5,
  5 --> 25,
  2 --> 25,
  25 --> -1

2) Given an n x n matrix and a number x, find position of x in the matrix if it is present in it. Else print “Not Found”. In the given matrix, every row and column is sorted in increasing order. The designed algorithm should have linear time complexity.

3) Min Heap in JavaScript

4) Implement an algorith to determine if all the characters in the string are unique. What if you cannot use additional data structure.

5) Write a function to check if given string is a permutation of a palindrome.
    Example:
    Input: Tact Coa
    Output: True (taco cat is a palindrome)
    
6) Given an image represented by NxN matrix, where each pixel in the image is 4 bytes, write a method to rotate the image by 90 degrees. Can you do this in place?

7) Remove duplicate elements from a linked list.

8) Write a code to partition linkedlist around  value x, such that all nodes less thanx comebefore all nodes greater than or equal to x. If x is contained in the list, the values of x only need to beafter the elements less than x. The partition element x can appear anywhre in the right partition
  Input: 3->5->8->5->10->2->1
  output: 3->1->2->10->5->5->8
